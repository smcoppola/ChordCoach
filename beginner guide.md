## STEP #1: LEARN THE WHITE KEYS (THE EASY WAY)

The keys on a piano are named after the first seven letters of the alphabet, starting with **A**, and they repeat over and over again on the piano. So, it's like the alphabet song, but instead of letters, we have piano keys! For every seven keys you play, you complete one set. Learning the white keys may seem daunting, but you can identify them easily by looking at the black keys, which are grouped in twos and threes.
* **Finding C, D, and E:** The first white key to the immediate left of a group of two black keys is always **C**. Moving to the right, the next white key is **D**, then **E**.
* **Finding F, G, A, and B:** Look to the left of the first black key in a group of three to find **F**. If you move to the right and look to the left of the second black key, you will see **G**. Following the exact same pattern, the next keys are **A** and **B**.

If you are looking for a particular white key, start by identifying the nearest black keys and use these patterns to guide you.

### Visual Guide
* A full keyboard is displayed with the repeating **A**, **B**, **C**, **D**, **E**, **F**, **G** keys labeled in teal text.
* To highlight visual patterns, the groups of two black keys and groups of three black keys are circled in alternating red and green marker-style strokes.
* Individual mini-keyboard diagrams illustrate the exact location of each specific white key relative to the black keys. The target white key is highlighted in solid teal (e.g., the **C** key is highlighted in teal right below and to the left of the two black keys).

## STEP #2: LEARN MAJOR & MINOR CHORDS

When you play multiple notes together on a piano, it creates a chord, which acts as the building blocks of music. Major chords sound happy and bright, while minor chords sound sad or gloomy. To build these chords from scratch, you must understand a **half step**, which is the distance between any two adjacent keys on the piano. Moving to the key immediately to the right or left means moving one half step.

* **Building Major Chords:** Starting on any note, count up four half steps, then add another three half steps. This formula is $4 + 3$ half steps. For example, starting on **C**, counting up four half steps lands on **E**, and adding three more half steps lands on **G**, creating a **C** major chord (**C**, **E**, **G**).
* **Building Minor Chords:** Starting on any note, count up three half steps, then add another four half steps. This formula is $3 + 4$ half steps. For example, starting on **A**, count up three half steps to **C**, then add four half steps to get **E**, resulting in an **A** minor chord (**A**, **C**, **E**).

### Visual Guide
* A keyboard diagram demonstrates half steps by placing red dots on adjacent white and black keys to clearly show the smallest possible interval.
* An illustration of a **C** major chord shows the keys **C**, **E**, and **G** highlighted in teal, accompanied by the mathematical formula "$4 + 3$ HALF STEPS".
* An illustration of an **A** minor chord shows the keys **A**, **C**, and **E** highlighted in teal, accompanied by the mathematical formula "$3 + 4$ HALF STEPS" circled in red.
* Comprehensive charts display all major and minor chords in music. These feature a mini keyboard for each specific chord (such as **A**, **A#/Bb**, **B**, **C**, etc.) with the correct three keys highlighted in teal.

## STEP #3: PLAY THOUSANDS OF SONGS

A chord progression is a sequence of chords played in a particular order to form the harmonic foundation of a song. It is the backbone of the song's melody and gives it a particular mood. The most popular chord progression of all time consists of **C major**, **G major**, **A minor**, and **F major**. 

* To play a song with this progression, simply play **C major**, then **G major**, then **A minor**, and finally **F major**, and repeat that sequence over and over again. 
* This catchy and memorable progression is used in countless hit songs across a variety of genres, including "Let It Be" by The Beatles, "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey, and "Someone Like You" by Adele.

When reading chord progressions for songs, chords are shown above the lyrics to indicate when you should switch to the next chord. Major chords are typically written as a capital letter, while minor chords are written as a capital letter with a lowercase 'm' beside it (e.g., **Am**).

### Visual Guide
* Four keyboard diagrams display the famous progression, with the active keys highlighted in teal: **C MAJOR** (**C**, **E**, **G**), **G MAJOR** (**G**, **B**, **D**), **A MINOR** (**A**, **C**, **E**), and **F MAJOR** (**F**, **A**, **C**).
* Visual diagrams demonstrate how to play with both hands. The "RIGHT HAND" diagram shows a full **C** major chord (**C**, **E**, **G**) highlighted in teal. The "LEFT HAND" diagram shows the corresponding single **C** notes on the lower end of the keyboard highlighted in teal.

## STEP #4: GET IN THE RIGHT MINDSET SO YOU DON'T QUIT

It is unfortunate but true that many adult beginners quit playing the piano because they have a poor mindset. Learning to play can be challenging, but you can stay motivated by adopting a positive approach.

* Set realistic goals and celebrate your progress along the way, no matter how small.
* Do not be too hard on yourself when you make mistakes; they are a natural part of the learning process, and everyone makes them.
* Find ways to make practicing enjoyable, whether that is by playing your favorite songs or setting up an inspiring practice space.

### Visual Guide
* A stylized, hand-lettered graphic reads "STAY Positive" surrounded by small drawn stars, reinforcing the encouraging mindset required for learning.

## STEP #5: USE YOUR PRACTICE PLANNER SHEETS TO STAY ON TRACK

Organizational tools are essential for staying focused, motivated, and on track as you work to improve your piano playing skills. 

* **Letter to Yourself:** Write a letter to yourself dated 90 days from now detailing all of the things you have accomplished and all of the songs you have learned to help visualize your progress.
* **Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Plans:** Plan out your practice schedule for the coming days, weeks, and months to ensure you are dedicating enough time to practicing each day.
* **Repertoire and Dream Songs Lists:** Keep track of the songs you are currently working on as well as the songs you hope to learn in the future.

### Visual Guide
* An outline graphic of a spiral-bound notebook features the word "Planner" written across the front cover in script.

## STEP #6: USE THE DAILY PRACTICE SHEETS (THE ROUTINE THAT WILL ACCELERATE YOUR PROGRESS!)

To accelerate your piano progress, implement a structured daily practice routine utilizing three simple methods.

1.  **Practice All Your Chords:** Practice chords with your right hand and left hand (separately and then together). Move from the bottom of the piano to the top without stopping to get used to moving easily across the keys. Start with a few chords per day and speed up your tempo over time.
2.  **Focus on 1-3 Favorite Songs at a Time:** Learn your right hand first, then add your left hand. Practice with the actual song playing so that you keep a steady beat, and set goals for when these songs will be completed.
3.  **Focus on Productive Practice:** Prioritize what you want to accomplish with each practice session instead of simply measuring how much time you spend sitting at the piano.

### Visual Guide
* The principles of the routine are outlined as clear, daily priorities ("CHORDS PRACTICE," "1-3 SONGS AT A TIME," "FOCUS ON YOUR GOALS") that transition directly into blank planner template pages.
